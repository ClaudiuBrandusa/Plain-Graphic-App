# Plain-Graphic-App

# Foreword
Before we start I must say this is an old project. I worked on it while I was learning tkinter(from python) and some parts of the code are a bit buggy. The code architecture is a mess and I will update the program in the future or I will remake it in C#/C++.
The code lacks commentaries but I will add them after the refrctor.  
Btw, I hope this repository will help someone who is trying to learn tkinter or PIL.

# Description
This app can:  
- design lines and rectangles.
- delete the designed structures.
- save the project in a file with .pga extension.
- save the project as image (as .png or .jpg).
- load the project from a .pga file.
- undo/redo changes.
- set the width of the drawings.
- start a new file.

# Dependencies
You will need:  
- Python 3
- Tkinter, for UI.
- Pillow (PIL), for image generation.

# How to use
You can draw by using the tools from the left part of the app or you could try the hotkeys.
Hotkeys:
- l for drawing a line.
- r for drawing a rectangle.
- e for starting/stopping the erase tool.
- ctrl z for undo.
- ctrl y for redo.

If you do forget the hotkeys, then you can see the list by selecting the 'help' button.

# Saving
You can save your work by selecting the 'save' button and then there will be two options. Saving as project file (PGA) or Image (png, jpg).

# Loading
You can load the project file by selecting the 'load' button.

# Width
Change the width for the next drawings by inserting the new width on the input from the left tool box.
